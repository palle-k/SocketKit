Output stream for writing to an underlying target.

**Implementation notes:**

Only the function `write(data: UnsafePointer<Void>, lengthInBytes byteCount: Int) throws`
should be implemented. Other `write`/`writeln` functions should not be implemented
as they are already implemented as an extension which will call the 
`write(data: UnsafePointer<Void>, lengthInBytes byteCount: Int) throws`
function.
