Creates a TLS/SSL session for the provided streams.

This currently works for server side only.

The provided Certificates are used for encryption.

When creating an encrypted stream pair, a handshake will automatically be performed.
If the handshake fails, a TLSError will be thrown.

- parameter inputStream: Input stream which should be used as an underlying stream to the TLS/SSL input stream.
Reads the encrypted data.

- parameter outputStream: Output stream which should be used as an underlying stream to the TLS/SSL output stream.
The encrypted data will be written to it.

- parameter certificates: Array of certificates for encryption. The first certificate has to contain a private key used for
decryption. A private key will automatically be included if the certificate is loaded from a PKCS12-file.

- throws: A TLSError indicating that the TLS/SSL session could not be created.

- returns: An encrypted input and output stream.
